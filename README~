MSc Thesis: Recommending Independent Music to Twitter users -
======================================================================

The purpose of this project was to identify if implicit data (1.5 million users, 11 million tweets stored
in MongoDB) from Twitter can be used to recommend music to users. An open-source
recommendation library in Python using several packages such as Divisi2, NumPy, SciPy and
PySparse was used to generate the recommendations. 

This library contained an implementation of a model-based collaborative filtering approach namely Matrix Factorization using Singular Value
Decomposition. The implemented algorithm/library was adopted and improved to recommend
relevant music artists to the target user based on their listening history and the other users in the
network who had similar preferences.
